# Calculator.
By learning the basic concepts on python you can *create/build a Calculator* by adding some extra files and features. In this project, I have created a simple 
Calculator with simple and basic function of Python.Once you understand a single line and its function , it won't be hard enough to understand the whole function
for this project.


**This is how my Calculator looks like.**


Well it is still not looking that perfect because of the position is still not fixed properly. Moreover, I am using *tkinter* file to create the calculator and some of the features of this files are not working on Mac. So I finally ended up with this look.

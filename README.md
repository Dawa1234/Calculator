# Calculator.
By learning the basic concepts on python you can *create/build a Calculator* by adding some extra files and features. In this project, I have created a simple 
Calculator with simple and basic function of Python.Once you understand a single line and its function , it won't be hard enough to understand the whole function
for this project.
